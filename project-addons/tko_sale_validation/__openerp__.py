If an order sale is higher that a configured value it must be validated.
Only users that are part of new group Sale/Validator can authorize a sale order.
The validator can write a message indicating why the sale must be corrected or was canceled, so author knows why.
The author of sale order can correct and propose it to validation again, he has a filter to see refused sales in tree view.
The authorization data and user are registered in database, for future check.''',
